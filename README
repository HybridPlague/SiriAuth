This is a modified version of SiriProxy by plamoni (which was based off applidiums 'Cracking-Siri') which allows non-iPhone 4S users to use Siri.

Requirements:

 -An A4 chip device (iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4, iPhone 3GS, iPad [1])
 -A listening Siri (Please don't ask where to get this, Google is your best friend)
 -A UNIX system (Linux, Mac)
 -Some general knowledge about computers.


To install all needed stuff for this to work, just run 'sudo ./install.sh' (no quotes)

If you already have all the stuff installed to run it, you can generate certificates by running:

./scripts/certs.sh

then once you've done that, install ca.crt to your device.

You need valid auth keys from an iPhone 4S, to get these, check out my other git repo 'AuthGrabber' (https://github.com/StanTheRipper/AuthGrabber)

If you have valid auth data, open up siriAuth.rb and replace the appropriate info where it says:

 XAceHostKey = 'ace'

 ValidationDataKey = 'validationdata'

 AssistantIDKey = 'assistantid'

 SpeechIDKey = 'speechid'

(You don't need a fancy data converter for the ValidationData btw)

Then to run the auth server, its just 'sudo ruby ./start.rb' (no quotes)

and yes, you will need to update the key(s) every 24 hours.


All credit goes down to these people:

 -Applidium for creating Cracking-Siri
 -plamoni for using Cracking-Siri to create SiriProxy
